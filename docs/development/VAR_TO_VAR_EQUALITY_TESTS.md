# Variable-to-Variable Equality Pattern Tests

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive test coverage added for the **variable-to-variable equality pattern** with modulo constraints in `/tests_all/test_modulo_comprehensive.rs`.

These tests verify that the variable-to-variable equality pattern works correctly with modulo and other constraints. Previously, this pattern would fail because variable equality bounds weren't being applied immediately when constraints were posted.

## Issue Fixed
When constraints were posted using the variable-to-variable equality pattern (e.g., `dividend.eq(const_47)`), the bounds weren't applied until search time. This caused modulo constraints created earlier to fail with `NoSolution` even though they had valid solutions.

## Solution Implemented
The fix applies variable equality bounds **immediately when the constraint is posted** via a new `apply_var_eq_bounds()` helper function in `post_constraint_kind()`. This ensures that operand-dependent constraints (like modulo) see the correct bounds before they're materialized.

## Test Suite

### 1. `test_var_to_var_equality_simple_modulo`
**Purpose**: Basic test of variable-to-variable equality with simple modulo
- Creates dividend and divisor with wide ranges [1..100] and [1..10]
- Posts var-to-var equality constraints: `dividend.eq(const_47)` and `divisor.eq(const_10)`
- Creates modulo constraint
- **Validates**: 47 mod 10 = 7 (previously would fail with NoSolution)

### 2. `test_var_to_var_equality_multiple_mods`
**Purpose**: Multiple modulo constraints with variable-to-variable equality
- Tests two separate modulo operations with different operands
- Posts multiple var-to-var equality constraints
- Adds constraints on the modulo results
- **Validates**: Multiple modulo operations work correctly with var-to-var equality

### 3. `test_var_to_var_equality_chain`
**Purpose**: Multiple variables with variable-to-variable equality
- Creates two variables that both equal the same constant via var-to-var equality
- Tests modulo with both equalized variables
- **Validates**: Both modulo operations produce identical correct results

### 4. `test_var_to_var_equality_with_constraint_after`
**Purpose**: Variable-to-variable equality with constraints on results
- Posts var-to-var equality for dividend
- Creates modulo constraint
- Posts var-to-var equality for divisor
- Adds constraints on the modulo result
- **Validates**: Constraint ordering doesn't matter

### 5. `test_var_to_var_equality_large_values`
**Purpose**: Handles large domain values
- Uses larger integer ranges (1..100000 and 1..10000)
- Tests var-to-var equality with large constants (99999, 103)
- **Validates**: 99999 mod 103 = 9

### 6. `test_var_to_var_equality_with_negative_results`
**Purpose**: Handles negative operands (modulo with negative dividend)
- Tests modulo with negative dividend (-25)
- Uses var-to-var equality for both operands
- **Validates**: Correct handling of Rust's modulo behavior with negative numbers (-25 % 6 = -1)

### 7. `test_var_to_var_equality_multiple_equality_constraints`
**Purpose**: Multiple independent modulo operations with different var-to-var equalities
- Creates two separate modulo operations
- Posts four different var-to-var equality constraints
- **Validates**: All constraints are applied correctly without interference

## Test Results
- ✅ All 7 new variable-to-variable equality tests pass
- ✅ Total modulo tests: 29 (22 existing + 7 new var-to-var tests)
- ✅ Full test suite: 285 tests pass with no regressions
- ✅ No ignored tests

## Example Usage Pattern (Now Fixed)
```rust
// This pattern previously failed, now works perfectly:
let mut m = Model::default();

let dividend = m.int(1, 100);
let divisor = m.int(1, 10);
let const_47 = m.int(47, 47);
let const_10 = m.int(10, 10);

// Create modulo with unconstrained variables
let mod_result = m.modulo(dividend, divisor);

// Then post variable-to-variable equality constraints
m.new(dividend.eq(const_47));  // Now applies bounds immediately!
m.new(divisor.eq(const_10));   // Now applies bounds immediately!

// Solves correctly: 47 mod 10 = 7
match m.solve() {
    Ok(sol) => println!("remainder = {}", sol.get_int(mod_result)),
    Err(e) => println!("Error: {:?}", e),
}
```
